1. Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an SSH brute force attack from the internet.
- Disable SSH login with password into the Web Service Instance
- Restrict the IPs that are allowed to communicate to Web Service Instance by providing CIDR block or exact IP address

2. Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket;
 even in the instance that API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data?
- Enable server-side encryption on the S3 bucket
- Enable least privillege access to S3 content
