*** Poor security practice 1 ***
An IAM role with full access to s3 objects.
This role should only have access to specific buckets and allow only necessary actions. Allowing full access would expose a vulnarability to change content in any S3 bucket of AWS account

*** Poor security practice 2 ***

S3 buckets have no server-side encryption enabled and the feature Block Public Access for buckets are disabled. 
Not encrypting the contents of the s3 buckets could allow people who shouldn't have access to the objects to view the objects in the buckets.
