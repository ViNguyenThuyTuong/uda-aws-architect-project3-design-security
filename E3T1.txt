I've been waiting for more than an hour but no Findings on  GuardDuty even though the attack had been succeeded (please refer E3T1_guardduty_attack_succeed.png). 
I went through https://knowledge.udacity.com/questions/987733 and changed "Frequency for updated findings to 15 minutes" but the issue still remains.
According to the answer from mentor, this is an common known issue. So I followed he/she guideline, submiting it and noted down a explaination for reviewer.

**** I would try with a guess ****
1. What findings were detected related to the brute force attack?
GuardDuty may show an UnauthorizedAccess brute force for the EC2 instant.

3. Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information?
According to the AWS documentation  
"Amazon GuardDuty is a security monitoring service that analyzes and processes Foundational data sources, such as AWS CloudTrail management events, AWS CloudTrail event logs, VPC flow logs (from Amazon EC2 instances), and DNS logs"

The details for this attack could be found in the VPC flow logs.
The logs will show requests being sent from the one instance to a specific IP indicating that the instance is being used for an SSH brute force attack.

Thank you!
