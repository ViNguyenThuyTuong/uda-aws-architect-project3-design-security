1. Identify tools that will allow you to do the following: 
a. Scan infrastructure as code templates
  CFRipper: https://github.com/Skyscanner/cfripper

b. Scan AMIâ€™s or containers for OS vulnerabilities. 
  Clair: https://github.com/quay/clair

c. Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities.
  AWS Config: https://aws.amazon.com/config/
  
2. For each tool - identify an example compliance violation or vulnerability that it might expose.
CFRipper: S3BucketPolicyPrincipalRule (Checks for non-allowed principals in S3 bucket policies).
Clair: Old libraries and images can have many bugs and security vulnerabilities (refer CVE: https://cve.mitre.org/).
AWS Config: s3-bucket-public-write-prohibited (Checks if your Amazon S3 buckets do not allow public write access. The rule checks the Block Public Access settings, the bucket policy, and the bucket access control list).
