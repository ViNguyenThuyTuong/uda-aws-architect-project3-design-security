1. What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet-facing attack surface of the web application instance.
Enabling WAF to protect the web application.

2. Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
No. Using VPC private endpoints for S3 bucket only control the access to it within the network but already exposed unauthorized access would not be solved.

3. Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
No. Applying default encryption will not retroactively encrypt all the existing files. 

4. The changes you made above were done through the console or CLI; describe the outcome if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment?
This will reset all the changes we did and replaces with original configurations as in cloud formation templates.
